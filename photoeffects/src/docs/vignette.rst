Makes the edges of the photo less bright, creating an oval frame around its central part.

.. cpp:function:: int vignette(cv::InputArray src, cv::OutputArray dst, cv::Size rect)

   :param src: Source 8-bit three-channel image.
   :param dst: Destination image of the same size and the same type as **src**.
   :param rect: Size of rectangle describes an ellipse, whose center is at the center image.
   :return: Error code.

The algorithm.

#. Create a new 3-channel image, which is interpreted as BGR image.

#. For every channel calculate :math:`dist`, :math:`radius\_ellipse` and :math:`coefficient`, where
   :math:`dist` is a distance between the current pixel and the center of image;
   :math:`radius\_ellipse` is a radius of ellipse in the this point which belongs the same line as a pixel;
   :math:`coefficient` is a number which multiplies the intensity channel.

   The :math:`coefficient` is calculated by the following formula:

   .. math::

      coefficient = 1 - ((dist - radius\_ellipse) / (max\_radius - radius\_ellipse)),
   
   where :math:`max\_radius` is a distance between the pixel (0, img_src.cols) and the center image.

#. Convert image to a BGR format.

Example.

|srcImage| |dstImage|

.. |srcImage| image:: vignette_before.jpg
   :width: 40%

.. |dstImage| image:: vignette_after.jpg
   :width: 40%
